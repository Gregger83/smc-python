Introduction
============
This is the smc-python library to interface with the Stonesoft Management Center.

This acts as an front-end to simplify interactions and simplify scripting when looking
to integrate automated functionality. 

The smc-python library also has a CLI that provides a command completion syntax to provide
guidance on commands to be run, and can be run remotely from the Stonesoft Firewalls. All
actions interact with the Stonesoft Management Center (SMC), and commands specific to the FW's are
proxied by the SMC to the individual deviecs. 

A good place to start is the Installation and Getting Started section of the help docs.

Current versions are validated using:

* Stonesoft Management Server 5.10, 6.0, 6.1, 6.1.2 (Windows/Linux)
* Python 2.7.x, 
* Python 3.4, Python 3.5 (version >= 0.4)
