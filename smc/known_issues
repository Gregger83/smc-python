* Locations were introduced in SMC API version 6.1. However locations are not searchable using query parameters in
version 6.1. 
To obtain a list of SMC locations in version 6.1, use the following logic (without 'name' filters):
for x in describe_location():
	if x.name == 'the_location_im_looking_for':
		print "Do something"
